	/// <remarks>
	/// Gaussian pseudo-random generation can be useful if you want a bell shaped curve distribution of numbers.
	/// What this means is numbers half way between the min and max values are much more likely than
	/// numbers on the extreme edge. If you were to generate numbers between 1 and 10, it would be more
	/// likely a 5 would be generated than a 1 or a 10.
