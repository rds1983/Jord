|G|Guild|Place where you can level up

## Fighting

Simply move on a enemy to attack it.
The percentage probability of landing a hit is calculated using the formula:

`probability = 50 + HitRoll * 8 - ArmorClass`

I.e. if the attacker's HitRoll is 4 and the target's ArmorClass is 30, then there's 52% that the hit will land.

## Leveling Up

In order to level up, collect required amount of experience/gold(you can view it at character window) and move on guildmaster(who is located in the building with 'G' sign at entrance).

It'll raise your **overall level**, which affects attributes such as hitpoints, mana, stamina as well as their regen. Also it affects base hitroll.

Raising an **overall level** grants you a class level point, which can be used to raise **class levels**(which also is performed at the character window).

Raising **class levels** allows to learn new abilities, to wear better equipment. Also it opens up new forge recipes.
